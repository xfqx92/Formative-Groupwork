known as the computer.</p1>

    <br><p2 style="font-family:arial;color:rgb(14, 3, 3);font-size:20px" >A computer is a device that has the capability of storing its own memory by operating under the control of instructions. This then enables the computer to accept data,
 which is also known as inputting information. To follow this, the computer then processes specified rules according to the data. The next action the computer takes is to generate results. 
This action is also referred to as output. Lastly, the computer stores the information for use at a later time. This is also known as storage.</p2>
    <br><p3 style="font-family:arial;color:rgb(6, 5, 20);font-size:20px">Today, you can find computers almost anywhere. Some of these locations are to include the home, your place of business, school, local library and area drug store. Some other locations are restaurants, hospitals, doctor's office and dental office to name a few.</p3>
    <br><p4 style="font-family:arial;color:rgb(4, 0, 255);font-size:20px">Within the home, computers can be used to manage bills, shop department or specialty stores, converse with family members and friends far and near via email. You can also play games on it, listen to music, watch movies and students can even do homework assignments on it as well.
In the workplace, computers are used to create and compile invoices and also produce reports. Computers are also used to converse via email by staff members through memos and letters. Some companies have their employees submit their timesheets via the computers.
Some examples of how schools incorporate the use of computers with their students is by having the professor assign their students homework on the internet which is to be completed by a designated deadline.</p4>

    <br><p style="font-family:arial;color:rgb(162, 0, 255);font-size:20px;">The two products, Toyota’s Human Support Robot (HSR) and the Power Assist Suit from Panasonic, were demonstrated to the public for the first time in Tokyo.

      The HSR, a small white robot with built-in facial features, will assist wheelchair users at the Olympics, which begin in July 2020.
      
      The robots can carry food and other goods, guide viewers to their seats and provide event information.
      
      “We will support people at the Olympics and at the stadium in wheelchair accessible areas,” said Minoru Yamauchi, who is in charge of Toyota’s 2020 robots program.
      
      “In terms of service, we will be offering stress-free entry and viewing and the robot can also carry bags and other luggage items for the customers.”</p>
