### Interest of content 

* Lots of content, good font sizes and images mean that the reader will be kept interested.

> Excellent

### Visual presentation

* The visual presentation is basic but this helps focus the reader on the content. More consistency possibly?

> Sound

### Written presentation

* Use of colours make paragraphs very clear, however, line breaks can do a similar thing.

> Very Good

### Validity of HTML

* The HTML has few issues. 
* Could use bootstrap grid.

> Very Good

### Evidence of collaboration

* Good informative commit information
* Evidence in commits that pages were worked on separately and then merged to the same site. Author information is not complete on index.html
* All the content was completed in time, before the practical.

> Very Good
